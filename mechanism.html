                     There are many devices which can be used to make a contactless payment.Credit cards and debit cards are most common example
                        of that but some other devices are shown here. A device that contains this technology is recognised by a logo made of our
                        bold lines making a wave.

                    <p class="left">
                        In each device, there is a chip called NFC chip that emits radio waves. It also contains an antenna that is built into a
                        plastic to secure the connection with a contactless reader.It is also known as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID).
                        These are two main components that allow the customers to tap and pay. To make a payment with a contactless card,
                        hold the card near a payment terminal (known as an RFID reader) and it will process further.

                    <img src="images/rfid_technology.webp" alt="image of RFID technology" class="image left">

                    <p class="right">
                        When card is inside the field of NFC or RFID reader, it picks up the signal, communicates with the card and processes
                        the payment. In other words terminal activates and recognizes the contactless-enabled card or device and exchanges
                        payment account details. Transaction data is transferred to issuer along with payment account details via acquirer.
                        Issuer validates the dynamic cryptogram, authenticates the data, and authorizes transaction.
                    <br>
                        The payment terminal will say if the payment was successful or not. Sometimes if it doesn't work, you'll need to
                        use your pin instead.
