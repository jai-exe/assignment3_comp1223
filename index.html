                 <h2>About the Topic</h2>
                 <p>
                      Contactless payment-also known as 'Tap-and-Go'-is a popular and secure way to make a purchase for products or services.
                      In this method we can make a payment using a debit, credit or smartcard i.e. chip card. Some no-credit or debit card
                      contectless payments also include transit cards, Apple Pay, Android Pay and Google Wallet. This method uses technology called
                      RFID technology or near-field communication (NFC).
                  </p>
                 <h2>How It's Done!</h2>
                  <p>
                      To make a contactless payment, all you have to do is just tap the card or phone with required features near a point-of-sale
                      terminal that contains the contactless payment technology. Since contactless payments do not require a signature or a
                      personal identification number (PIN), transaction sizes on cards are limited. The minimum amount for a contactless
                      transaction varies by country and by the bank.
                  </p>
                 <h2>A Brief History</h2>
                  <p>
                      Looking back to history, this technology has been used by merchants and retailers since the period of 1990s. Since then,
                      it has spread out to include thousands of banks, credit card companies, merchants, and retailers around the world.(https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contactless-payment.asp)
                      South Korea's transit authority in Seoul brought one of the world's first contactless payment systems. Launched in 1995,
                      the system later became known as UPass, offering riders a quick and easy way to pay for bus trips using the contactless
                      system. Mobil offered one of the first contactless payment systems called Speedpass in 1997. Customers were able to pay
                      for gas using a special fob loaded with cash at participating gas stations.
                  </p>
                 <h2>Global Reach</h2>
                  <p>
                      Currently this technology is more popular in Australia, Canada, South Korea and the United Kingdom.
                      In U.S., this technology has still not got much attraction in consumers. Canada has come up with the idea of 'Interac'
                      technology, which has the same concept of contactless payment and it used to make payment by credit or debit card.
                      Also in Ontario(Canada), transit card which is known as 'Presto' card, has this technology. About 70% of transactions $50
                      or lower in Canada are paid by tap.(https://creditcards.usnews.com/articles/how-do-contactless-credit-cards-and-payments-work)
                  </p>
                 <h2>Security Concerns</h2>
                  <p>
                     Even with the accessibility of contactless payment, many consumers are tensed about the security of their cards.
                      There have been stories in the media about criminals skimming card data using smartphones to read tap cards in consumers'
                      wallets. The range at which a card can be read is very short and, even if the criminal is close enough to steal data and
                      do a transaction, he cannot create a copy of the card. This is not true of magnetic strip cards. That said, the chip
                      and pin card are still the most secure, as they can't be duplicated and they require data (your pin) that is not
                      contained anywhere on the card.
